# Taylor diagram

Meteorological Taylor diagrams are a statistical tool used in the field of meteorology to assess the accuracy of weather forecasting models by comparing them to observed weather data. The diagrams were first introduced by Jolliff et al. in 2009 and are named after John Taylor, who also developed the related Taylor chart. The technique has since been widely adopted by meteorologists and weather forecasters as a means of evaluating the performance of weather forecasting models.

The development of meteorological Taylor diagrams is a response to the need for a more comprehensive and intuitive way of assessing the performance of weather forecasting models. The diagrams enable forecasters to compare the performance of different models in terms of their correlation, bias, and amplitude, using a single graphical representation.

The significance of meteorological Taylor diagrams lies in their ability to provide a comprehensive and intuitive assessment of the accuracy of weather forecasting models. By comparing the performance of different models in terms of correlation, bias, and amplitude, forecasters can identify the strengths and weaknesses of each model and make more informed decisions about which model to use for a particular forecast. This is particularly important for the planning and management of critical infrastructure, such as transportation systems, power grids, and water resources.

In conclusion, meteorological Taylor diagrams are a valuable tool for the evaluation of weather forecasting models. They provide a comprehensive and intuitive assessment of the accuracy of different models, which is essential for making informed decisions about which model to use for a particular forecast. As technology continues to advance, meteorological Taylor diagrams are likely to become even more sophisticated and useful in the years to come.

## Import data

Import the necessary libraries and packages by convention.

```python
import pandas as pd
```

And we consider the following panda dataframe data.

```python
data = pd
```
