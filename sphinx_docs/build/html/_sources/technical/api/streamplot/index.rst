.. py:function:: streamplot(axes, x, y, u, v, density=1, linewidth=None, color=None, cmap=None, norm=None, arrowsize=1, arrowstyle='-|>', minlength=0.1, transform=None, zorder=None, start_points=None, maxlength=4.0, integration_direction='both', broken_streamlines=True)

   Draw streamlines of a vector flow.

   Parameters
   ----------
   x, y : 1D/2D arrays
       Evenly spaced strictly increasing arrays to make a grid.  If 2D, all
       rows of *x* must be equal and all columns of *y* must be equal; i.e.,
       they must be as if generated by ``np.meshgrid(x_1d, y_1d)``.
   u, v : 2D arrays
       *x* and *y*-velocities. The number of rows and columns must match
       the length of *y* and *x*, respectively.
   density : float or (float, float)
       Controls the closeness of streamlines. When ``density = 1``, the domain
       is divided into a 30x30 grid. *density* linearly scales this grid.
       Each cell in the grid can have, at most, one traversing streamline.
       For different densities in each direction, use a tuple
       (density_x, density_y).
   linewidth : float or 2D array
       The width of the streamlines. With a 2D array the line width can be
       varied across the grid. The array must have the same shape as *u*
       and *v*.
   color : color or 2D array
       The streamline color. If given an array, its values are converted to
       colors using *cmap* and *norm*.  The array must have the same shape
       as *u* and *v*.
   cmap, norm
       Data normalization and colormapping parameters for *color*; only used
       if *color* is an array of floats. See `~.Axes.imshow` for a detailed
       description.
   arrowsize : float
       Scaling factor for the arrow size.
   arrowstyle : str
       Arrow style specification.
       See `~matplotlib.patches.FancyArrowPatch`.
   minlength : float
       Minimum length of streamline in axes coordinates.
   start_points : Nx2 array
       Coordinates of starting points for the streamlines in data coordinates
       (the same coordinates as the *x* and *y* arrays).
   zorder : float
       The zorder of the streamlines and arrows.
       Artists with lower zorder values are drawn first.
   maxlength : float
       Maximum length of streamline in axes coordinates.
   integration_direction : {'forward', 'backward', 'both'}, default: 'both'
       Integrate the streamline in forward, backward or both directions.
   data : indexable object, optional
       DATA_PARAMETER_PLACEHOLDER
   broken_streamlines : boolean, default: True
       If False, forces streamlines to continue until they
       leave the plot domain.  If True, they may be terminated if they
       come too close to another streamline.

   Returns
   -------
   StreamplotSet
       Container object with attributes

       - ``lines``: `.LineCollection` of streamlines

       - ``arrows``: `.PatchCollection` containing `.FancyArrowPatch`
         objects representing the arrows half-way along streamlines.

       This container will probably change in the future to allow changes
       to the colormap, alpha, etc. for both lines and arrows, but these
       changes should be backward compatible.
